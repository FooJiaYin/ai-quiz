        "hello大家好，欢迎回到链接的频道，你知道吗？全球每天平均要喝掉225亿贝卡，这是什么概念？他全球一共才81个人的，也就是说，平均4个人里边就有一个人，每天要喝掉一杯咖啡，像我们平时喝的，比如说速溶咖啡罐装咖啡胶囊咖啡，你去咖啡厅喝的咖啡、咖啡粉、咖啡豆，还有那种听着很亮。厉害的什么蓝山咖啡猫屎咖啡等等。等等，你就拍这里头竟然也有这么一条鄙视链儿了，所以今天咱们就来聊一聊，到底什么样的咖啡才是好咖啡怎么样？喝咖啡就能喝出得装饰咖啡，其实他做出来，主要分三个步骤，首先你先动动第二步呢就把它烘培成，这个咖啡豆儿就咱平时那种看着黑乎。第三步呢，是把，它给研磨好了之后做成，咖啡，但是其实每一步都彰显着咖啡的歌，我们先来说说这个原材料，因为我平时看到的那些咖啡豆就黑不溜秋，我都已经烤好了，那种，我开始以为这咖啡豆他是长在地里头，我就给你一个种子一样子飞，也是咖啡的，是长在树上的，然后他从一棵树咖啡树上结出来的那种。小果子也特别漂亮红红的跟，那小樱桃似的你如果，把那个皮给扒开里边儿这两半儿，这就是我们平时看到的那个咖啡的，就相当于生的状态，有的时候我们把它叫做绿卡，也就是green coffee it，我们平时喝了咖啡，其实最常见的分两大类，一类呢，叫做arabica一类叫做如巴基斯，坦就是阿拉比卡和罗布斯塔这两种豆儿呢，我先说结论，简而言之。就是up i be up of reject讲，我们把它简称叫阿斗和罗道好了这个阿斗呢，一般来讲是比这个罗斗更优质的，这是结论大家记住了所以如果你挑想要力格高一点的洞，我们就找这种arabic百分之百的好吧，比如说你看你像这种，这不是下饭，就你可以看的很清楚，他这会且是百分之百的阿拉比卡就说明他这里边不参。萝卜丝，他就有一些他上面会写我味道，touch罗伯斯塔这种你你不知道他那个踏实踏实的多踏实，所以就尽量还是贤百分之百的，比如说下次你去男朋友家，你看他买那个咖啡豆鸭肉、巴斯，塔那你这时候就得干，你这么说，亲爱的这个是巴斯塔的咖啡因含量太高了，会让你心慌，对你身体不好，所以之后呢，我们一定要买rrap卡豆，这样就可以一扫你女汉子的形象立马，就变成一个特别清纯可爱迷人的小女生，这两种都是最主要的区别，一个是咖啡因的含量，一个是他的一些咖啡的风味的元素咖啡因呢，就是罗布斯塔豆要更高一些，因为罗布斯塔，他叫罗巴斯塔，因为就是有bug的对吧，就是感觉特别强壮，咖啡。含量高，也能让他更好的去强壮嘛，就抵抗外界的这些环境就是动词，是不怎么挑环境，像罗豆呢，就一般是东半球，比如说像越南印尼，我非洲的一些地方产的会比较多，所以我不知道大家有没有喝过那种越南咖啡机，v name is it就感觉他那里边齁甜齁甜，给你讲好多有人糖精，就是长江这些东西就因为他那铲子。那种豆都是罗道，就刺激了。刺激性很强，所以他得要特别甜的东西，然后就冲掉那些苦涩阿斗呢，你other，side d就比较娇嫩，没那么好养活，他没有那么高的咖啡因含量，所以他抵抗外界环境的能力就差一些，所以你得给他更多的呵护，就感觉像个千金大小姐一样，但是呢，大小姐大小姐的美对吧，他呢，就是更多的糖，更多的指所以还有其他的一些风味儿元素，所以整个喝起来，咖啡的那个感觉口感、味道就感觉更高级一些，所以呢，他也是在笔试上人上的，像我们平时有的时候，你听说那些产地感觉很厉害的地方，什么牙买加的蓝山咖啡有什么？曼特宁咖啡科纳咖啡，但这些地方呢主要都是产值，阿拉比卡第二个步骤就是这个烘焙。有空背上千万不要读哄配音都烘培就太掉价了，就比如说有的时候去星巴克，你要买那个主的就是不是coffee，你就看那是三个大桶，对吧一个写的blog就是感觉轻度烘培的烘焙，然后第二个是那个medium medium must就是中度，然后第三个呢是dark roast就是重度，比如说你去买咖啡的时候也是还像这个这种呢，就是它是一个lros的，就是轻度的烘焙，然后呢，比如说你看像这个我还今天特意把我们家里所有的咖啡都搬出来了，你看这个呢就写的是medium rose就是中度的这个痘，但这就是属于dark roast就是重度，这是什么意思呢其实就是相当于比，如说你要去点个牛排或者你要奸鸡蛋，你要几分熟对吧你要三份的时候5分钟还7分手，那就是轻度中度重度，如果说是轻度他就会感觉可能更更深一点，然后你会感觉到那种草本的酸涩，比如说下一次你再跟朋友出去喝咖啡，不要喝了一口，说，嗯，这咖啡怎么感觉酸酸的呢？这时候知识点就可以上来了，你说他酸可能因为他是轻度烘焙的，不如我们来一杯。做烘焙的，怎么样？然后再往后呢，他越来温度越高，温度越高之后，咖啡里头水分蒸发了，然后唐呢就慢慢的焦糖化了，然后那个油呢，也一点一点a就被轰出来了，所以你越往后，他这个逗本身颜色越深，然后再开始有点发光发亮，你喝的时候也会感觉像炭烤的那种感觉更纯一点就更甜一点，更感觉roasted这种呢？一般来讲就是重度的，一般来讲，就是那种特别好的咖啡豆或者说有点咖啡那种发烧友，他们要品咖啡，也就是评价那个咖啡的时候，这种情况下，他们一般是会选更轻度的，就是light roast这种的咖啡因为这种可能，他没有那么重的碳化弄中后面的整个化学反应，他保持的这个咖啡本身原有的那个。疯味儿就更足一点。其实一般磨好的咖啡豆，它是可以保存很长时间的，但是一定要注意的就是要避光避热一朝下次如果你，看有朋友把咖啡豆放在冰箱里充满知识点的小可爱，就又要上线了，就说这咖啡豆我千万不能放冰箱里冰箱太潮了，还有一个我之前去买咖啡，你去超市，你经常看这个咖啡上就有这么一个小孔，你看就像这个能看到这儿有一个气孔。对吧，我最开始看到这个气口的时候，我就是拿着咖啡什么一级好香，我也觉得这个设计简直太人性化了，我可以还是咖啡豆稳一点，然后感觉哪个气味我最喜欢，我就买哪一个这根本就不是给你纹的，这口呢，它其实是一个单向的气阀，因为咖啡豆是在哄好之后呢，它是会排出来一下二氧化碳的气体，其实是给这看。这都是起到一个保护的作用，所以呢，他防止这个字儿特别胀，他就得有一个单向的启发，它是单向的嘛，就不让氧气其他东西进去腐蚀这个咖啡冻人家是咖啡的保护气体，你给人都挤出来了，你还想不想让咖啡豆好好活着，所以后这个千万不能挤这个太low了。我们来说说这个最后一步，我把你这叫做咖啡泡咖啡冲茶在煮咖啡专业的名词就叫萃取，比如说咱学会这个词儿，下次你跟你男朋友出去喝咖啡的时候，你就说我们现在到了最后一个萃取的步骤，就会感觉特别文艺，我为什么不用带小姑娘出去的点，因为我上次被人骂你这样有点太固化，女性的形象了，不太好，所以小姑娘跟男朋友也可以萃取听着很专业，其实说白了，他就是把咖啡里面那些味儿溶到水里头，其实一般你会听到很多各种各样感觉很厉害的做法又，是什么手？冲咖啡挂耳、咖啡什么法式french，但是我觉得对咱们普通人来讲，可能主要可以分成两大类，一类呢，是浸泡式。内饰意式浓缩，你们先说这浸泡浸泡式呢，就是我们平时在家里见的比较多的，就是让这个咖啡粉、咖啡磨好了之后，粉跟水充分的接触，要么呢，你是弄个咖啡机，对吧，那个水加热完之后，从那咖啡粉里头过出去律师来一杯咖啡或者是有那种感觉很厉害的手，冲咖啡，然后那个小漏斗着留下来，手中咖啡挺漂亮。再有呢，就是像那种我要吐个槽，有一个发明叫挂耳式咖啡就是一个密封的咖啡袋儿，然后打开之后，加在被子上像两个耳朵，像挂在杯子上，这个他竟然是日本的一个发明，它就从此之变成了专利了这一个，然后首充的这种的一般最好的，你的现磨对吧，让咖啡那个风味儿最饱满的时候，然后你再一冲。好这样，你才能得到一杯最香浓、最醇厚的咖啡比较优雅，在那儿很安静的一个下午，艾拿着一本书手冲一杯咖啡享受一个惬意的午后。就会给人一种很很安静，我觉得还挺就是relaxing的那种感觉，另一种挺常见的，就是那种意式浓缩的咖啡机，这个就是你去像什么星巴克或者其他基本所有的咖，啡厅都用的那种很大的意式咖啡机就是以机器很大，然后每次弄的咖啡粉，然后再弄个小东西给你弄那，然后放进去就开始那个水弄下来了，那种他是在9个大气压的情况下，在92度的水温用25毫升的水萃取30毫升的咖啡液，要的就是这个精准所以他最主要的跟刚才浸泡式的区别呢，就是他是通过高压9个大气压，要不然，你想那个水肯定过不去，那么细的浓缩咖啡色加压之后呢，就是让这个水尽量的少。所以最后得到的就是浓缩的咖啡液对，他喝起来就不会像刚才那个那么这种呢，一般你可以单核就叫s pls，然后呢，你也可以跟各种其他的奶奶沫巧克力酱搭配就是我们平时经常你要喝拿铁摩，卡卡布奇诺这些各种各样不同的搭配都是意式浓缩来的这种一般机器还挺贵的，所以自己在家可能你。很少看没那种一个大机器，但他确实萃取很多香气，包括带那种沫，然后味道也比较好，所以很多人也是很想在家里自己做这个，所以当时雀巢就出来了，这个nice ass就可以自己在家做，asansol当然只有这种浓缩的咖啡，它打出来才会有那种上面一层咖啡木，耳就是喝着感觉那个泡沫也很香的感觉，因为那个我们之前，小丽老师给大家讲了，这是因为那个咖啡里头有那种表面活性剂的成分，然后它里面有没有那么多水因为是浓缩的嘛，所以才能打出来的草木，但像刚才我们说的那种浸泡式的咖啡因为水的浓度太大了，所以就不太会形成那种泡沫，这个来喝着就还是感觉挺醇厚，挺香甜的，而且我自己是特别喜欢去咖啡厅里。文那个咖啡机的那个打出来，那个粉末那个香气心旷神怡好，下次我们可就知道怎么点了，比如说下次你跟男朋友一起去，我们久违的小霖奶茶店，然后咱们也得喝杯咖啡对吧，这时候，你就可以说我可以想要一杯蓝山的阿拉比卡豆，我要中度烘焙，然后最后呢，可以给我来一个s special，double shot无糖无奶。谢谢这时候，你男朋友在边上就会说。给我来一杯一样的，其实说白了，刚鄙视链也是开玩笑的我觉得，只要你喝的高兴，喝的开心，然后你能享受到咖啡给你带来的那个比较舒适的感觉，那喝什么都是随你在那儿咖啡里面就是有咖啡因的，所以不要一天喝太多，要不然有的时候你晚上睡不着，觉什么就不太好，当然和还没有好处，我进我哥，我身边的朋友。报告显示，咖啡具有通肠排便的作用，所以有些人早上喝一杯催屎咖啡，也是有利于调整你的生活作息行今天就，分享到这儿了拍。\n",

Now,if there's only one thing you're gonna remember about making really good scrambled eggs.It's that they need to be cooked low and slow,so I'm going to turn my heat on to a medium low.And then I'm going to add about 1/2 a teaspoon of coconut oil to the pan.Now you could use any fat that you want here.Butter works, olive oil works,but I personally love that sweet flavour that the coconut oil adds to the eggs.Now once the oil has melted and you've got a nice thin coating on the bottom of your pan,you're going to add in the eggs.I like to give them one last mix and then in there you go.And this is when I salt them.One pinch of salt right over the top.Now remember,you've got to be patient here guys.So this is our chance to reach in and find that inner Buddha because you don't want to touch him until you start to see the outside of the eggs.Set it.Once you see that you're going to pull,take the spatula and gently pull the edges of the egg towards the center of the pan and you'll see the uncooked egg oozes out and these light fluffy curds of eggs start to form.Just keep moving it along.Then,right before your eggs are where you like them,shut off the heat,because eggs will go from light and fluffy and delicious to a rubber tire just like that.Look at that gorgeous.So now that you guys have got this basic technique down,get in your kitchens and start cooking,and you're going to quickly see that scrambled eggs can be a clean eater's best friend.For more simple and nutritious recipes,tips and ideas,be sure you check out cleananddelicious.com I'm Danny Spies,and I'll see you next time with another how to.Hmm.When you're good.You're good.When you're good, you're good.My eggs are good.

        "Que pague sólo como están viendo un canal en vivo en Jerez y un día observó un cambio así.Telesync en tocaba qué mejor momento que hacerlo.Acá hay un vídeo, pero hacemos no como se hace en personalmente, no he hecho un cambio antes también se utiliza con esto también es un experto en todos, en cambio de aceite, entonces sí también quieren conseguirlo.Aceite para ustedes un cambio aceite pueden comunicarse con él toda la información que sea la inscripción, como siempre comenzaremos haciendo un paso a paso cómo usar estación cambió al sitio para que usted pueda hacer en su casa para hacer un cambio, si tienes, indicó, saca de tarso.Una llave de la medida de todo para sacar el tapón del aceite suele ser media 17 que tienen que realizar los primeros motor, una Gata, una botella para poder poner el aceite que sacar el motor, el aceite y grasa, poner el grado hacer ya que necesitas, depende de tu motor en la marca y es una elección propia, un filtro de aire con filtro, aceite y herramienta para quitar el filtro aceite anterior, el primer paso después de haber levantado el capó, de revisar cómo se cuenta el estado del aceite que está en este momento motor para eso tienen la varilla de aceite, suele ser amarilla y tienen el símbolo, así son los retiras.Aquí lo limpias con papel, entonces sabes que tienes la varilla.Limpia la vuelves a meter en el lugar, pero es un poco.Todavía tiene un tipo de medición diferente, en este caso hay dos puntitos y el aceite tienen encontrarse entre esos dos puntos que significan el máximo y el mínimo.Como todo está bien en un problema y prosigamos con el proceso creciente paso es ubicar la tapa del aceite, mantener el símbolo aceite y suele decir hoy la retiras y procedemos a lavar el carro antes del carro es importante determinar en qué lado del cartel SAT para esa manera poder levantar el carro del lado opuesto y así forzar el aceite a que salga fácilmente por el hueco es muy importante encontrar un vehículo para no romper nada.Y que será antes de manera segura y no vaya a verse una exposición a la Gata.Procedemos a levantarla.Para empezar, ponemos en la batalla que vamos a utilizar, la ponemos en dirección hacia el tapón para que se te caiga y 2º, Vamos a proceder a utilizar una llave, en este caso la llave bueno, pero están numero 1712 hs, colocamos la llave y procederemos a aflojar lo que es el tapón una vez aflojado, este debería de ser una mano, vamos a tener cuidado y porque el tapón tiene una wacha para que haga la presión hacia el cárter del aceite, no se vacío.Esperamos a que vote absolutamente todo el aceite, como vieron el doctor, no tenemos en la mano y no dejamos que cargue la batería dependiendo el motor año Madrid subió en diferentes partes, pero suele ser una manguera o tubo negro que sale el motor y termine en una caja, parecía que tengo enfrente, hay diferentes métodos para poder anclar el filtro a la base, en este caso tengo clips, pero que son tornillos y diferentes en realizar, pero fácilmente sacas todos los clips que sujetan a tu madre.Y con cuidado.Los sacas y lo pones a un gustaba.Cómo pueden ver mi filtro ya tiene bastante tiempo, YA todo eso cambió.A estado chancado, esto ocurre cuando entra bastante cantidad de aire motor y doblarlo y lo que vamos a usar un color mucho más bonito está todo en orden, es tan simple como reemplazar en el lugar donde estaba revisar que todo está haciendo buen contacto y engancha a los clips que por lo general suelen ser 4 y así es.Simple, terminamos con el filtro aire, entonces el filtro de aceite tiene lo que es esta forma, hay que saber.El código de nuestro filtro de aceite para poderlo comprar, que está muy apretado con este tipo de herramienta, vamos a poder les ajustarlo para poder sacarlo en el carro, dejo aquí, vamos a encontrar que el filtro de aceite se encuentra debajo del motor al costado del cartel, para lo cual vamos a proceder a utilizar la herramienta y justo y se supone que debería de salir con la mano.Hay que tener cuidado al sacar el filtro de aceite por el motivo de que ahí los adentro, que si se roban podría meterse en grave problema y hay que intentar que el filtro salga recto.Porque caso contrario vas a derramar bastante 6.Cómo podemos apreciar, ya se retiró del filtro y cómo le dije a caídos, hay por hay que esperar que termine de crear tanto lo que es el aceite del filtro y del cartel, lo más recomendable es usar una batea un poco más grande para que así puedan cubrir absolutamente todo eso en el Carter salió el aceite, es algo chino, salió con un poquito de tierra en el hilo, lo que se hace simplemente se limpia y lo ideal siempre es cambiarla en cada servicio.Como siguiente paso YA una vez que hayamos sacado del filtro viejo, vamos a desempaquetar el filtro nuevo.Siempre hay que procurar que nuestros filtros, los filtros que compremos y prevengan, sellado para mantener la originalidad y bueno que ellos sean de muy buena calidad, en absolutamente todos nosotros, vamos a encontrar GPS, para lo cual con un poco de aceite que hemos sacado, tenemos que volver a absolutamente todo este GB.Para que esta manera de lubricado y al momento de ponerlo no nos ocasione derrames de aceite o buena semana y como les comente, estos son los siglos, los cual es no se dejen de robar y además de eso tenemos que verificar que hojeen el antiguo no se ha quedado pegado en esta zona de acá consiguiente eso podemos proceder a poner el filtro nuevo.Tenemos que ver que encaje bien una vez insertado, tiene que correr suavemente y con la mano le vamos a dar.Hasta que ajuste una vez que ya está ajustado, vamos a volver a utilizar nuestra herramienta.Tenemos que dejarlo lo suficientemente ajustado.Estoy muy ajustado ni muy suelta una vez que puede haber puesto el filtro, vamos a proceder a limpiar donde va colocado lo que es el tapón del Carter, procedemos a limpiar para que no quede ninguna impureza IAE con la tapa del Carter limpio, procederemos a colocarlos igual manera como el filtro debe entrar en la posición correcta, asegúrese de que esté bien para que de esa manera no produzca CSIC y el número 17 de manera anterior y ajustar, recuerden.Ajustar lo suficiente no más de lo debido porque se puede robar los Sims y con esto hemos terminado todo por la parte de abajo del carro de proceder a bajar del carro, en este caso para el carro D Joaquín debido a su kilometraje del equipo demostró que tiene vamos a echar un aceite 1030, es un aceite multigrado, Bueno, siempre que comprobar la originalidad tanto del aceite, porque en este mercado hay bastante sombra y para lo cual siempre tenemos que ver que el presidente esté sellado y no tenemos el cpe.En este caso nuestra bandera si la tiene, voy a hacer el intento de poner aceite o feriados, derramar mucho batallar.Depende de cada motor determinar cuando se te necesita, en mi caso en motores uno litros, por lo que va a usar casi todas las maneras, pero aún sin mediante una varilla para saber cuanto falta para el punto preciso.7 pasos perder el carro.Medimos el aceite después de haber prendido el motor y todo está bien, los niveles de estar en su lugar y así de simple que podemos terminar el cambio de aceite.Espero que les haya servido mucho este vídeo, no se olviden de la red Live comentada y suscribirse para ver los vídeos que subo todas las semanas la gente cuídense.\n",

        "If it slides in then that means the chain is worn.\n",
        "I also have a video on how to measure chain where using a 12 inch.\n",
        "Cooler so I'll include in the description a link to that video as well.\n",
        "So but checking the chain is very easy.\n",
        "So if the chain is worn,\n",
        "go ahead and replace it with a brand new chain.\n",
        "Either way,\n",
        "we want to go back and check out the cassette,\n",
        "especially if the chain is worn. OK,\n",
        "so now identifying a worn cassette or freewheel is a little trickier and a lot of times it just takes a little bit of experience to know what you're looking at.\n",
        "One thing to keep in mind is people tend to ride in some cogs more often than others,\n",
        "so those costs are going to wear faster than the other cogs that are not written in as much,\n",
        "and also the smaller cogs.\n",
        "Tend to wear faster than the big cogs under the same riding amount because the chain is in contact with fewer teeth on the smaller cogs than they are on the bigger ones.\n",
        "And so each of the teeth is just going to wear a little bit faster than the others.\n",
        "But we're going to look at is.\n",
        "Look at the at the COGS and look for misshapen teeth.\n",
        "So just look at the teeth and you might find like 1-2 three of the COGS,\n",
        "that the teeth are worn differently than the teeth on say the largest cogs there that they're just going to be.\n",
        "The teeth are going to be like skinnier.\n",
        "They're going to have weird ramps there.\n",
        "So that's one thing to look at.\n",
        "They also make some tools.\n",
        "This one here is called camc sprocket checker.\n",
        "And the problem with the tools is they don't work equally well on all different cassettes and freewheels.\n",
        "So you have to kind of take them with a grain of salt.\n",
        "But you kind of drape these over here like this and this is like a little little lever.\n",
        "So I'm going to pull this down here and put tension on this chain and I should be able to like lift these smaller links off of there.\n",
        "They should come up pretty freely like that.\n",
        "Now if the.\n",
        "Cog was warned to where there was more a wider gap between the teeth there then I wouldn't be able to like lift these up as well and so that would be an indication that that the this cassette would need to be replaced.\n",
        "I have another tool here,\n",
        "this is called A roll off HG check and this is supposedly designed for Shimano hyperglide cassettes,\n",
        "but it works basically the same way as the camc sprocket checker.\n",
        "Again use these with a grain of salt.\n",
        "But if you suspect that the cassette or freewheel is worn,\n",
        "you're seeing the difference in the teeth,\n",
        "go ahead and replace it. I mean,\n",
        "you always just try a different cassette that you know is good and see if the skipping goes away.\n",
        "And if that's the case,\n",
        "then you know that it's a warrant cassette.\n",
        "OK,\n",
        "so now another thing that might be an issue is stiff chain links.\n",
        "These chain links here should pivot freely at the rivets there.\n",
        "But sometimes you get like an old chain,\n",
        "it's got like a little bit of rusty or whatever and.\n",
        "You'll get a pair of links that are just kind of stuck or barely move.\n",
        "And what happens is as they go through the derailer pulleys,\n",
        "the derailer will kind of have to pull forward.\n",
        "The case will kind of pop forward and pop back as those links go through.\n",
        "And so you kind of get a popping feeling every time those things go through.\n",
        "So what you can do is you can get some oil onto the pivot point there and then just start working those links until it kind of frees up.\n",
        "Or better yet,\n",
        "you can go ahead and just replace the chain with a brand new chain and because sometimes you'll get.\n",
        "Other pairs of links that are a little stiff and that might just be an indication that the chain is just not in good shape,\n",
        "so go ahead and replace it anyway.\n",
        "Now another thing to be aware of.\n",
        "I don't know the history of what's been done with your bike.\n",
        "If you have mismatched components in your drivetrain,\n",
        "that could also cause like auto shifting fan of shipping where the chain is going to try to jump between cars.\n",
        "If you're say running like A9 speed shifter with an 8 speed cassette,\n",
        "or you're running Shimano shifters with a Campagnolo red railer or something like that,\n",
        "mismatched incompatible components like that can cause issues as well.\n",
        "So that's something.\n",
        "To look into and make sure that everything is compatible.\n",
        "Now one other thing that might cause the change,\n",
        "actually trying to like auto shift and change back and forth is frame flex.\n",
        "The the frames may seem relatively stiff,\n",
        "but they do flex a little bit.\n",
        "And especially like if you're climbing a hill and you're standing up on the pedals and you're really pedaling,\n",
        "the frame might be twisting a little bit back and forth and that might be just enough to cause the chain to try to jump up to other cogs and back.\n",
        "So again, check the.\n",
        "Trailer adjustment went on back so where it might be just slightly off and but it could be that the just the frame is flexing.\n",
        "It might be just an issue with a very lightweight frame.\n",
        "So if that's the case then you might want to just try to climb hills in a seated position,\n",
        "which is often better anyway anyway.\n",
        "Those are kind of the main causes for slipping,\n",
        "skipping, jumping, auto shifting,\n",

        "neural networks are inspired by the brain,\n",
        "but let's break that down.\n",
        "What are the neurons,\n",
        "and in what sense are they linked together?\n",
        "Right now, when I say neuron,\n",
        "all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number,\n",
        "specifically a number between zero and one.\n",
        "It's really not more than that.\n",
        "For example,\n",
        "the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 * 28 pixels of the input image,\n",
        "which is 784 neurons in total.\n",
        "Each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel,\n",
        "ranging from zero for black pixels up to one for white pixels.\n",
        "This number inside the neuron is called its activation,\n",
        "and the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number.\n",
        "So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network.\n",
        "Now jumping over to the last layer.\n",
        "This has 10 neurons,\n",
        "each representing one of the digits.\n",
        "The activation in these neurons,\n",
        "again some number that's between zero and one,\n",
        "represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit.\n",
        "There's also a couple layers in between,\n",
        "called the hidden layers,\n",
        "which for the time being.\n",
        "Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled in this network.\n",
        "I chose 2 hidden layers,\n",
        "each one with 16 neurons,\n",
        "and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice.\n",
        "To be honest,\n",
        "I chose 2 layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment.\n",
        "And 16, well,\n",
        "that was just a nice number to fit on the screen.\n",
        "In practice,\n",
        "there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here.\n",
        "The way the network operates,\n",
        "activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer.\n",
        "And of course,\n",
        "the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer.\n",
        "It's meant to be loosely analogous to how,\n",
        "in biological networks of neurons,\n",
        "some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire.\n",
        "Now,\n",
        "the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits,\n",
        "and let me show you what I mean by that.\n",
        "It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image,\n",
        "that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer,\n",
        "which causes some pattern in the one after it,\n",
        "which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and the brightest neuron of that output layer.\n",
        "Is the network's choice, so to speak,\n",
        "for what digit this image represents.\n",
        "And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next,\n",
        "or how training works,\n",
        "let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently.\n",
        "What are we expecting here?\n",
        "What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?\n",
        "Well, when you or I recognize digits,\n",
        "we piece together various components.\n",
        "A nine has a loop up top and a line on the right.\n",
        "An 8 also has a loop up top,\n",
        "but it's paired with another loop down low.\n",
        "A4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that.\n",
        "Now in a perfect world,\n",
        "we might hope that each neuron in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents,\n",
        "that anytime you feed in an image with,\n",
        "say, a loop up top, like a nine or an 8,\n",
        "there's some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to 1.\n",
        "And I don't mean this specific loop of pixels.\n",
        "The hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron.\n",
        "That way,\n",
        "going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits.\n",
        "Of course,\n",
        "that just kicks the problem down the road,\n",
        "because how would you recognize these subcomponents or even learn what the right subcomponents should be?\n",
        "And I still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next,\n",
        "but run with me on this one for a moment.\n",
        "Recognizing a loop can also break down into sub problems.\n",
        "One reasonable way to do this would be to 1st recognize the various little edges that make it up.\n",
        "Similarly,\n",
        "a long line like the kind you might see in the digits one or four or seven,\n",
        "well, that's really just a long edge.\n",
        "Or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges.\n",
        "So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges.\n",
        "Maybe when an image like this one comes in,\n",
        "it lights up all of the neurons associated with around 8:00 to 10:00 specific little edges,\n",
        "which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and those light up the neuron associated with a nine.\n",
        "Whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question,\n",
        "one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network.\n",
        "But this is a hope that we might have a sort of goal with the layered structure like this.\n",
        "Moreover,\n",
        "you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks.\n",
        "And even beyond image recognition,\n",
        "there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that breakdown into layers of abstraction.\n",
        "Parsing speech, for example,\n",
        "involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds,\n",
        "which combine to make certain syllables,\n",
        "which combine to form words,\n",
        "which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts,\n",
        "etc.\n",
        "But getting back to how any of this actually works,\n",
        "picture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next.\n",
        "The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges,\n",
        "or edges into patterns or patterns into digits,\n",
        "and to zoom in on one very specific example.\n",
        "Let's say the hope is for one particular neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here.\n",
        "The question at hand is what parameters should the network have?\n",
        "What dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern?\n",
        "Or any other pixel pattern,\n",
        "or the pattern that several edges can make a loop,\n",
        "and other such things? Well,\n",
        "what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer.\n",
        "These weights are just numbers.\n",
        "Then take all of those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights.\n",
        "I find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own,\n",
        "and I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value.\n",
        "Now,\n",
        "if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels 0 except for some positive weights in this region that we care about,\n",
        "then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about.\n",
        "And if you really wanted to pick up on whether there's an edge here,\n",
        "what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels.\n",
        "Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright but the surrounding pixels are darker.\n",
        "When you compute A weighted sum like this,\n",
        "you might come out with any number.\n",
        "But for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between zero and one.\n",
        "So a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between zero and one.\n",
        "And a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function.\n",
        "Also known as a logistic curve. Basically,\n",
        "very negative inputs end up close to 0,\n",
        "very positive inputs end up close to 1,\n",
        "and it just steadily increases around the input zero.\n",
        "So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is.\n",
        "But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0.\n",
        "Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than,\n",
        "say, 10. That is,\n",
        "you want some bias for it to be inactive.\n",
        "What we'll do then is just add in some other number,\n",
        "like -,\n",
        "10 to this weighted sum before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function.\n",
        "That additional number is called the bias.\n",
        "So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on,\n",
        "and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be.\n",
        "Before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active,\n",
        "and that is just one neuron.\n",
        "Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixel neurons from the first layer,\n",
        "and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it.\n",
        "Also, each one has some bias,\n",
        "some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid.\n",
        "And that's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons.\n",
        "That's a total of 784 * 16 weights along with 16 biases,\n",
        "and all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second.\n",
        "The connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them.\n",
        "All said and done,\n",
        "this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases,\n",
        "13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways.\n",
        "So when we talk about learning,\n",
        "what that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many,\n",
        "many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand.\n",
        "One thought experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand,\n",
        "purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges,\n",
        "the third layer picks up on patterns, etc.\n",
        "I personally find this satisfying rather than just treating the network as a total black box.\n",
        "Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate,\n",
        "if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean,\n",
        "you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work,\n",
        "but not for the reasons you might expect.\n",
        "Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions.\n",
        "By the way,\n",
        "the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down,\n",
        "don't you think?\n",
        "So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented.\n",
        "This is how you'd see it if you choose to read out more about neural networks.\n",
        "Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector,\n",
        "then organize all of the weights as a matrix.\n",
        "Where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer.\n",
        "What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left Here.\n",
        "By the way,\n",
        "so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra.\n",
        "So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means,\n",
        "take a look at the series I did on linear algebra,\n",
        "especially Chapter 3.\n",
        "Back to our expression.\n",
        "Instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently,\n",
        "we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product.\n",
        "Then as a final step,\n",
        "I'll wrap a sigmoid around the outside here.\n",
        "And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside.\n",
        "So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols,\n",
        "you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression.\n",
        "And this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster,\n",
        "since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication.\n",
        "Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers?\n",
        "Well, of course,\n",
        "the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in.\n",
        "So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function,\n",
        "one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one.\n",
        "Really,\n",
        "the entire network is just a function,\n",
        "one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers as an output.\n",
        "It's an absurdly complicated function,\n",
        "one that involves 13,000 parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns,\n",
        "and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squishification function.\n",
        "But it's just a function nonetheless,\n",
        "and in a way,\n",
        "it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated.\n",
        "I mean, if it were any simpler,\n",
        "what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits?\n",
        "And how does it take on that challenge?\n",
        "How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data?\n",
        "Well,\n",
        "that's what I'll show in the next video,\n",
        "and I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we're seeing is really doing.\n",
        "Now is the point, I suppose I should say,\n",
        "subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out.\n",
        "But realistically,\n",
        "most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube,\n",
        "do you?\n",
        "Maybe more honestly,\n",
        "I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie YouTube's recommendation algorithm are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you.\n",
        "Anyway, stay posted for more.\n",
        "Thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on Patreon.\n",

        "one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function.\n",

        "early networks use this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between zero and one.\n",
        "You know,\n",
        "kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active.\n",
        "Exactly.\n",
        "But relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore.\n",
        "Yeah, it's kind of old school, right?\n",
        "Yeah. Or rather,\n",

        "Yes,\n",
        "it's this kind of function where you're just taking a Max of 0 and a where A is given by what?\n",
        "You were explaining in the video and what this was sort of motivated from I think was a partially by a biological analogy with how neurons would either be activated or not.\n",
        "And so if it passes a certain threshold it would be the identity function,\n",
        "but if it did not,\n",
        "then it would just not be activated,\n",
        "so be 0. So it's kind of a simplification.\n",

        "what's the expected value of a random variable,\n",
        "what's the variance of a random variable?\n",

        "we will have review sessions on Fridays where we'll go over some of this prerequisite material as well.\n",

        "what expected value is.\n",
        "But if you are a little bit fuzzy on those concepts,\n",
        "what we'll go over them again at a discussion section on Friday.\n",
        "Also assume the familiar basic linear algebra,\n",
        "so hopefully that you know what's a matrix,\n",
        "what's a vector,\n",
        "how to multiply 2 matrices or multiply matrices in a vector.\n",
        "If you know what is an eigenvector then that's even better.\n",
        "If you're not quite sure what an eigenvector is,\n",
        "we'll go over it that you you, but yeah,\n",
        "we'll go over it I guess,\n",
        "and then a large part of this class.\n",
        "Is having you practice these ideas through the homework as well.\n",
        "As I mentioned later,\n",
        "a open-ended project and so one there we've actually until now we used to use Matlab and Octave for their proming assignments,\n",
        "but this year we're trying to shift the proming assignments to Python And so I think for a long time.\n",
        "Even today, you know,\n",
        "I sometimes use Octave to prototype because the syntax of Octave is so nice and just run very simple experiments very quickly.\n",
        "But I think the machine learning world is,\n",
        "you know,\n",
        "really migrating I think from Matlab Python world to increasing,\n",
        "excuse me,\n",
        "Matlab Octave world to increasingly.\n",
        "A Python maybe and then eventually for production Java,\n",
        "C kind of world and so we're rewriting a lot of the assignments So this causes quarter having driving that process so that so that this course that you could do more of the assignments maybe most maybe all of the assignments in Python numpy instead.\n",
        "Now, notes on the owner codes,\n",
        "we asked that, yeah,\n",
        "we actually encourage you to form study groups.\n",
        "So, you know,\n",
        "I've been fascinated by education for a long time.\n",
        "It's been a long time studying education and pedagogy and how instructors like us can help support you to learn more efficiently.\n",
        "And one of the lessons I've learned from the educational research literature is that for highly technical classes like this.\n",
        "If you form study groups you will probably have an easier time,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "So so CS2 and I would go for the highly technical material.\n",
        "There's a lot of maths.\n",
        "Other programs are hard and if you have a group of friends to study with,\n",
        "you probably have an easier time because you can ask each other questions and work together and help each other.\n",
        "Where we ask you to draw the line or what we ask you to to to do relative to the standards on the code is we ask that you do the homework problems by yourself.\n",
        "Right and and and more specifically,\n",
        "it's okay to discuss the homework problems with friends,\n",
        "but if you but after discussing homework problems with friends,\n",
        "we ask you to go back and write up the solutions by yourself without referring to notes that you know you and your friends had developed together.\n",
        "The classes on the code is written clearly on the class handouts posted digitally on the website.\n",
        "So if you ever have any questions about what is allowed collaboration and what isn't allowed.\n",
        "Please refer to that written document on the calls website where we described this more clearly.\n",
        "But all the respect for the Stanford on the code as well As for you know,\n",
        "for for students kind of doing their own work,\n",
        "we asked you to basically do your own work for the It's OK to discuss it,\n",
        "but after discussing home problems with friends,\n",
        "ultimately we asked you to write up your problems by yourself so that the homework submissions reflect your own work,\n",
        "right and.\n",
        "I care about this because it turns out that having CS239,\n",
        "you know CS239 is one of those classes that employers recognize.\n",
        "I don't know if you guys know,\n",
        "but they've been companies that have put up job ads that say stuff like so long as you got so last you complete the CS239,\n",
        "we guarantee you get an interview, right.\n",
        "I've, I've seen stuff like that.\n",
        "And so I think you know,\n",
        "in order to to maintain that sanctity of what it means to be a CS229 completer,\n",
        "I think I also all of you sort of.\n",
        "Really do your own work or stay within the bounds of accepted acceptable collaboration relatively on the codes.\n",
        "Let's see.\n",
        "And I think that if you know what this is,\n",
        "yeah.\n",
        "And I think that one of the best parts of CS229,\n",
        "it turns out, is excuse me, so.\n",
        "Sorry,\n",
        "I'm going to try looking for my mouse cursor.\n",
        "All right, sorry about that.\n",
        "My my my displays are not mirrorized,\n",
        "so this is a little bit awkward.\n",
        "So one of the best parts of the class is,\n",
        "oh shoot, sorry about that. All right,\n",
        "never mind. I won't do this.\n",
        "You could do it on.\n",
        "You could do it yourself online later.\n",
        "Yeah, I started using.\n",
        "I started using Firefox recently in addition to Chrome.\n",
        "To mix up,\n",
        "one of the best parts of the class is the class project.\n",
        "And so you know,\n",
        "one of the goals of the class is to leave you well qualified to do a meaningful machine learning project.\n",
        "And so one of the best ways to make sure you have that skill set is through this class and hopefully with the help of some of our Tas,\n",
        "we want to support you to work on the small group to complete a meaningful machine learning.\n",
        "Project.\n",
        "And so one thing I hope you start doing later today is to start brainstorming maybe of your friends some of the class projects you might work on and the most common class project that people do in CSC 9.\n",
        "Is to pick a area,\n",
        "pick an application that excites you and to apply machine learning to it and see if you can build a good machine learning system for some application area.\n",
        "And so if you go to the course website youknowcs229.stanford.edu and look at previous years projects,\n",
        "you see machine learning projects applied to pretty much,\n",
        "you know pretty much every imaginable application under the sun.\n",
        "Everything from.\n",
        "Diagnosing cancer to creating arts,\n",
        "to lots of projects applied to other areas of engineering.\n",
        "Applying to application areas in EE or mechanism or silver engineering or earthquake engineering and so on to applying it to understand literature to applying it to.\n",
        "I don't know and and and and and. So.\n",
        "If you look at the previous year's projects,\n",
        "many of which are posted on the course website,\n",
        "you can use that as inspiration to see the types of projects students complete completing this class are able to do.\n",
        "And I also encourage you to.\n",
        "You can look at that for inspiration you know to to get a sense of what you'll be able to do at the conclusion of this class,\n",
        "and also see if looking at previous year's projects gives you inspiration for what.\n",
        "You might do yourself,\n",
        "so we also know we we invite you I guess to do class projects in small groups and so after class today also encourage you to start making friends in the class,\n",
        "both for the purpose of forming study groups as well As for the purpose and maybe finding a small group to do a class project with.\n",
        "We asked you to form project groups of up to size 3 most project groups end up being.\n",
        "Size two or three,\n",
        "if you insist on doing it by yourself,\n",
        "right, without any partners,\n",
        "that's actually okay too.\n",
        "You're welcome to do that.\n",
        "But but but I think often you know having one or two others to work with may give you an easier time and for projects of exceptional scope.\n",
        "If you have a very, very large project,\n",
        "they just cannot be done by three people.\n",
        "Sometimes you know,\n",
        "let us know and we're open to, with, with,\n",
        "with to some project groups of size 4.\n",
        "But our expectation.\n",
        "But we do hold projects, you know,\n",
        "with a group of four to a higher standard than projects with size one to three,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "So what that means is that if your project team size is 1,\n",
        "two or three persons,\n",
        "the grading is 1 criteria.\n",
        "If your project group is bigger than three persons,\n",
        "we use a stricter criteria when it comes to grading class projects.\n",
        "OK, oh, and that reminds me.\n",
        "I know that. Let's see.\n",
        "So for most of you,\n",
        "since it's since this starts at 9:30 AM on the first day of the quarter,\n",
        "for many of you,\n",
        "this may be this probably your very first cause at Stanford.\n",
        "For how many of you?\n",
        "This is your very first closet. Stanford.\n",
        "Wow. Cool. OK, awesome, great.\n",
        "Welcome to Stanford.\n",
        "And there's someone next to you.\n",
        "Just raise their hand.\n",
        "Actually raise your hand again.\n",
        "So I hope that you know,\n",
        "maybe after class today if someone next to you raise their hand.\n",
        "Hope welcome down to Stanford.\n",
        "And then say hi and shoot yourself and big friends after it.\n",
        "Cool. Nice.\n",
        "Nice to see so many of you here.\n",
        "All right,\n",
        "so just a bit more on logistics.\n",
        "So let's see.\n",
        "In addition to the main lectures that we'll have here on Mondays and Wednesdays,\n",
        "CS229 also has discussion sections on held on Fridays that are and everything we do,\n",
        "including the See All the All the lectures and discussion sections are recorded and broadcast through SCPD through the online website and one of and discussion sections are taught usually by the TA's on Fridays.\n",
        "And attendance at discussion sections is optional.\n",
        "And what I mean is that you you know,\n",
        "you 100% promise there won't be material on the midterm that will sneak in from this kind of section.\n",
        "So it's 100% optional and you will be able to do all the homework and the projects without attending the discussion section.\n",
        "But what we use the discussion section for,\n",
        "for the first V discussion section,\n",
        "so you know this week, next week,\n",
        "the week after that we'll use the discussion sections to go over prerequisite material and greater depth,\n",
        "so.\n",
        "Go over linear algebra,\n",
        "Basic Problem Statistics.\n",
        "Teach a little bit about Python Numpy in case you're less familiar with those querying frameworks.\n",
        "So do that for the first few weeks,\n",
        "and then for the discussion sections that I held later this quarter,\n",
        "we'll usually use them to go over more advanced optional material,\n",
        "For example, CS229.\n",
        "A lot of the learning algorithms you hear about in the class.\n",
        "Rely on convex optimization algorithms.\n",
        "But we want to focus the cost on the learning algorithms and spend less time on convex optimization.\n",
        "So if you want to comment here about more advanced concepts and convex optimization,\n",
        "we'll defer that to discussion section.\n",
        "And then there are there are a few other advanced topics Hidden Markov Models,\n",
        "time series that we're planning to defer to the Friday discussion sections.\n",
        "Okay.\n",
        "So let's see cool.\n",
        "And and final bit of logistics for there'll be there are digital tools that some of you were seeing.\n",
        "But for this class will drive a lot of the discussion through the online website Piazza.\n",
        "How how many of you have used Piazza before?\n",
        "OK cool. Mostly wow all of you.\n",
        "That's pretty amazing. OK good. So so.\n",
        "Online discussion board for those of you that haven't seen it before,\n",
        "but definitely encourage you to participate actively on Piazza and also to answer other students questions.\n",
        "I think that one of the best ways to learn as well as contribute you know back to the cause as a whole is if you see someone else ask a question on Piazza.\n",
        "If you jump in and help answer that that that often helps you and helps your classmates.\n",
        "I strongly encourage you.\n",
        "To do that for those of you that have a private question,\n",
        "sometimes we have students reaching out to us with a personal matter or something that is not appropriate to share on the private farm room,\n",
        "in which case you're welcome to e-mail us.\n",
        "At the cost e-mail address as well and we also and the cost e-mail address,\n",
        "the teaching Staffs e-mail address on the course website you can find it there and contact us.\n",
        "But for anything technical or anything reasonable to share the cost which includes most technical questions and most logistical questions right questions like you know,\n",
        "Gee,\n",
        "can you confirm what date is midterm or or you know what happens can you confirm when's the handout for this going on and so on.\n",
        "For questions that are not personal or private in nature strongly encourage you to post on P answer rather than emailing us because statistically you actually get a faster answer.\n",
        "Posting this on posting on P answer than than you know if if you wait for one of us to respond to you and we'll be using grade scope as well to for for online grading and and if you if you don't know what grade scope is don't worry about it we'll we'll we'll send you links and show you how to use it later.\n",
        "Oh, and again,\n",
        "relative to one last thing to plan for,\n",
        "Unlike previous years where we taught CS229,\n",
        "so we're constantly updating the syllabus right?\n",
        "The technical content to try to show you the latest machine learning algorithms and the two big legible changes we're making this year.\n",
        "I guess one is Python instead of Matlab and the other one is instead of having a.\n",
        "Midterm exam,\n",
        "you know that's a time midterm we're planning to have a take home midterm this quarter instead.\n",
        "So I I don't know some some people just briefed and shocked you when I said that.\n",
        "I don't know what that means.\n",
        "Was that shock or happiness OK don't worry.\n",
        "Midterms are fun. You you, you love it.\n",
        "All right.\n",
        "So that's it for the that's it for the logistical.\n",
        "Aspects,\n",
        "let me check And so let me let me check.\n",
        "There are any questions? Oh yeah,\n",
        "go ahead. Canvas.\n",
        "This course is offered every quarter are all the renditions.\n",
        "Yeah. So that's interesting. Let's see,\n",
        "I think it's offered in spring and one other person.\n",
        "Yes. And teaching it.\n",
        "So someone else is teaching it in spring quarter and I actually did not know it was going to be offered in winter.\n",
        "Yeah, Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. So,\n",
        "so I think great guy and teaching it in,\n",
        "sorry, right, teaching it in spring.\n",
        "And I don't think is offered in Winset.\n",
        "Well this one section be recorded.\n",
        "Yes it will be.\n",
        "Oh and by the way if if you wonder why I'm recording the I'm repeating the question.\n",
        "I know it feels weird.\n",
        "I'm recording for the microphone so that so that people watching does that whole can hear the question.\n",
        "But both the lectures and the discussion sections will be will be recorded and put on their website.\n",
        "Maybe the one thing we do that's not recorded and broadcast are the office hours,\n",
        "right? Is that right? Yeah. Oh, oh.\n",
        "But I think this year we have a 60 hour.\n",
        "How many hours, 60 office hours per week.\n",
        "Right. Yeah, so, so,\n",
        "so hopefully I I just again we're we're constantly trying to improve the cause.\n",
        "In previous years one of the feedback we got was that the office hours are really crowded.\n",
        "So,\n",
        "so we have 6060 hours of about 60 office hours slots per week this year that that seems like a lot.\n",
        "So hopefully if you need to track down one of us track down the tea to get help,\n",
        "hopefully that'll that'll make it easier for you to do.\n",
        "So go ahead, say that again. Well.\n",
        "Oh well,\n",
        "let's just go things like when homeworks,\n",
        "would you be covering lectures?\n",
        "We have a yes.\n",
        "So we have 4 planned homeworks. Oh sorry.\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "And if you go to the if you go to the course website and click on the syllabus link that has a calendar with when each homework assignments go out and when will be due.\n",
        "So for Homeworks and project proposal,\n",
        "do you?\n",
        "Two weeks from now and and then final projects due at the end of the quarter,\n",
        "but all the all the exact dates are listed on the course website.\n",
        "Thank you. Sure. Yes,\n",
        "difference between this class and 229 A.\n",
        "Let me think how to answer that. Yes.\n",
        "So yeah,\n",
        "I know I was debating earlier this morning how to answer that business.\n",
        "I asked that a few times.\n",
        "So I think that what has happened at Stanford is that the volume of demand for machine learning education is just right,\n",
        "skyrocketing because I think everyone sees,\n",
        "everyone wants to learn this stuff.\n",
        "And so, so we've been,\n",
        "so the computer science department has been trying to grow the number of machine learning offerings we have.\n",
        "We actually kept the enrollment of CS239-A.\n",
        "At a relatively low number at 100 students.\n",
        "So I actually don't want to encourage too many of you to sign up because I think we might be hitting the enrollment cap already.\n",
        "So so please don't all sign up for C2298 because we 2298 does not have the capacity this quarter,\n",
        "but C2298 is a much less mathematical.\n",
        "And much more applied,\n",
        "relatively more applied version of machine learning.\n",
        "And so I guess I'm teaching CS229,\n",
        "a CS230 and CS239 this quarter.\n",
        "Of the three,\n",
        "CS229 is the most mathematical.\n",
        "It is a little bit less applied than CS229A which is more applied machine learning and CS230 which is deep learning.\n",
        "My advice to students is that CS229/CS229A,\n",
        "Let me write this down.\n",
        "I think I'm right.\n",
        "So CS229A is taught in the flip classroom format,\n",
        "which means that students taking it will mainly watch videos on the Coursera website and do a lot of programming exercises and then meet for weekly discussion sections.\n",
        "But it's a smaller class with Captain Romans.\n",
        "I I would advise you that if you feel ready for CS229 and CS230 to do those.\n",
        "But CS229,\n",
        "you know because of the math we do this is a this is a very heavy workload and pretty challenging class and so if you're not sure if you're ready for CS229/CS229A may be a good thing to to to take first and then.\n",
        "CS229/CS229A cover a broader range of machine learning algorithms,\n",
        "and CS230 is more focused on deep learning algorithms specifically,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "Which is a much narrow set of algorithms,\n",
        "but it is, you know,\n",
        "one of the hottest areas of deep learning.\n",
        "There is not that much overlap in content between the three classes,\n",
        "so if you actually take all three,\n",
        "you learn relatively different things from all of them.\n",
        "In the past we've had students.\n",
        "Simultaneously take 239 and 239-A and there is a little bit of all that you know they they do kind of cover related algorithms but from different points of view so so some people actually take multiple of these courses at the same time.\n",
        "But 239 A is more applied a bit more you know practical know how hands on and so on and and and much less mathematical and and CS230 is also less mathematical more applied more about kind of getting it to work where CS239-A.\n",
        "We do much more mathematical derivations in CST 29.\n",
        "Any other questions? Yes, someone had.\n",
        "So why don't you say that? What?\n",
        "I would generally prefer students not do that in the interest of time.\n",
        "But what? What do you want?\n",
        "Oh, I see. Sure. Go for it.\n",
        "Who's enrolled in two 39230? I oh,\n",
        "not that many of you. Interesting. Oh,\n",
        "that's actually really interesting. Cool.\n",
        "Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.\n",
        "I I just didn't want to set the presence of students using this as a following to run survey.\n",
        "So that was that was a that was a that was an interesting question.\n",
        "So thank you. Yeah, cool.\n",
        "All right. And by the way,\n",
        "I think you know,\n",
        "just one thing about Stanford is the AI world,\n",
        "machine learning world.\n",
        "AI is bigger than machine learning, right?\n",
        "And machine learning is bigger than deep learning.\n",
        "One of the great things about being a Stanford student is you can and I think should take multiple classes,\n",
        "right? I think that, you know,\n",
        "CST29 has for many years been the core of the machine learning world at Stanford.\n",
        "But.\n",
        "Even beyond CS229 is worth your while to take multiple classes and give you multiple perspectives.\n",
        "So. So if you want to be really effective,\n",
        "you know after you drive from stand there,\n",
        "you do want to be an expert in machine learning.\n",
        "You do want to be an expert in deep learning,\n",
        "and you probably want to know probably in statistics.\n",
        "Maybe you want to know a bit of complex optimization,\n",
        "maybe you want to know a bit more about enforcement,\n",
        "learning,\n",
        "know a little bit about planning,\n",
        "know a bit about lots of things.\n",
        "So so I I actually encourage you to.\n",
        "To take multiple classes, I guess. Cool.\n",
        "All right, good.\n",
        "If there are no more questions,\n",
        "let's go on to talk a bit about machine learning.\n",
        "So, all right,\n",

        "Overview of you know the major areas of machine learning and also and also give you a sort of overview of the things you learn in the next 10 weeks.\n",
        "So you know what is machine learning,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "It seems to be everywhere these days and it's useful for so many places and I think that.\n",
        "And and you know, and and and I, I,\n",
        "I feel like just to share with my personal bias,\n",
        "right.\n",

        "I think that's great. I hope,\n",

        "But the thing I find even more exciting is,\n",

        "I think that you know I think that every time there's a major technological disruption,\n",
        "which there is now through machine learning,\n",
        "it gives us an opportunity to remake large parts of the world.\n",
        "And if we behave ethically in the principal way and use these super powers of machine learning to do things that,\n",
        "you know, helps people's lives, right?\n",
        "Maybe we could.\n",
        "Maybe you can improve the healthcare system.\n",
        "Maybe we can improve,\n",
        "give every child a personalized tutor.\n",
        "Maybe you can make a democracy run better rather than make it run worse.\n",
        "But I think that the meaning I find in machine learning is that there's so many people.\n",
        "That are so eager for us to go in and help them with these tools that if if you become good at these tools,\n",
        "it gives you an opportunity to really remake some piece,\n",
        "some meaningful piece of the world hopefully in a way that helps other people and makes the world,\n",
        "kind of makes the world a better place is very cliche in Silicon Valley but but I think you know with these tools you actually have the power to do that and if you go make a ton of money that's great too.\n",
        "But I find.\n",
        "Much greater meaning in the work we could do.\n",
        "It gives us a unique opportunity to do these things.\n",
        "But despite all the excitement of machine learning,\n",
        "what is machine learning?\n",
        "So let me give you a couple definitions of machine learning.\n",
        "Author Samuel whose claim to fame was building a check displaying program,\n",
        "defined it as follows.\n",
        "So field study gives computably learned what being explicitly programmed and.\n",
        "You know,\n",
        "interesting when when author Samuel, many,\n",
        "many decades ago wrote the Checkers playing program.\n",
        "The debates of the day was can the computer ever do something that it wasn't explicitly told to do.\n",
        "And author Samuel wrote Checkers Playing program that through self play learned.\n",
        "What are the patterns of checkerboard that are more likely to lead to a win versus more likely to lead to a loss and learn to.\n",
        "Be even better than author Samuel the author himself at playing checkers.\n",
        "So back then there was a remarkable result that the computer programmer you know that could write a piece of software to do something that the computer programmer himself could not do.\n",
        "Right.\n",
        "Because this program became better at author Samuel at at at the task of playing checkers.\n",
        "And I think today we.\n",
        "Used to computers or machine learning algorithms outperforming humans on so many tasks.\n",
        "But it turns out that when you choose a narrow task like speech recognition on a certain type of task,\n",
        "you can maybe surpass human level performance.\n",
        "If you choose a narrow task like playing the game of goal,\n",
        "then by throwing really tons of computation power at it and self play,\n",
        "you can have a computer you know become very good at at these narrow tasks.\n",
        "But this is maybe.\n",
        "One of the first such examples in history of computing,\n",
        "and I think this is the one of the most widely cited definitions right,\n",
        "gives computers ability to learn well-being explicitly programming.\n",
        "My friend Tom Mitchell in his textbook defined this as a well posed learning problem.\n",
        "Program set to learn from experience E respected task T on some performance measure P if its performance T is measured by P improves experience E you know.\n",
        "And I I asked Tom this.\n",
        "I asked Tom if he wrote this definition just because he wanted it to rhyme and then he he he did not say yes,\n",
        "but I I, I, I I don't know.\n",
        "But in this definition,\n",
        "the experience E for the case of playing checkers,\n",
        "the experience E would be the experience of having a checkers play program play tons of games against itself.\n",
        "So computers,\n",
        "lots of patience and sit there for days playing games or checkers against itself.\n",
        "So that's the experience E The task T is the task of playing checkers.\n",
        "The performance measure P may be what's the chance of this program winning the next game of checkers?\n",
        "It plays against the Knicks opponent,\n",
        "right? So we say that.\n",
        "This is a well posed learning problem learning thing.\n",
        "Checkers.\n",
        "Now within this set of ideas of machine learning,\n",
        "there are many different tools we use in machine learning.\n",
        "And so in the next 10 weeks you learn about a variety of these different tools and so the first of them,\n",
        "and the most widely used one is supervised learning.\n",
        "Let's see,\n",
        "I want to switch to the whiteboard.\n",
        "Do you guys know?\n",
        "How do I erase the screen like that?\n",
        "All right, cool.\n",
        "So what I want to do today is really go over some of the major categories of machine learning tools and and and so the what you learn in the next by the end of this quarter,\n",
        "so the most widely used.\n",
        "Machine learning too,\n",
        "is today is supervised learning. Actually,\n",
        "let me check how how many of you know what supervised learning is.\n",
        "Like a 2/3 half of you maybe? OK, cool.\n",
        "Let me let me just briefly define it.\n",
        "Here's one example.\n",
        "Let's say you have a database of housing prices,\n",
        "and so I'm going to plot your data set where on the horizontal axis I'm going to plot the size of the house in square feet.\n",
        "You know,\n",
        "and then the vertical axis will plot the price of the house,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "And maybe a data set looks like that.\n",
        "And so horizontal axis,\n",
        "I guess we call this X and vertical axis we'll call that Y.\n",
        "So the supervised learning problem is,\n",
        "given the data set like this,\n",
        "to find the relationship mapping from X to Y.\n",
        "And so for example, let's say, let's say,\n",
        "let's say you have a,\n",
        "let's say you're fortunate enough to own a house in Palo Alto,\n",
        "right.\n",
        "And you're trying to sell it and you want to know how to price the house.\n",
        "So maybe your house has a size, you know,\n",
        "of that amount on the horizontal axis.\n",
        "I don't know,\n",
        "maybe this is a 500 square feet,\n",
        "1000 square feet, 1500 square feet.\n",
        "So your house is 1250 square feet.\n",
        "Right. And you want to know, you know,\n",
        "how do you price this house?\n",
        "So given this data set,\n",
        "one thing you can do is fit a straight line to it,\n",
        "right?\n",
        "And then you could estimate or predict the price to be whatever value you read off on the vertical axis.\n",
        "So in supervised learning,\n",
        "you are given a data set with input X and labels Y.\n",
        "And your goal is to learn a mapping from X to Y.\n",
        "Right now,\n",
        "putting a straight line to data is maybe the simplest possible,\n",
        "maybe the simplest possible learning algorithm,\n",
        "maybe one of the simplest learning algorithms given the data set like,\n",
        "there's there many possible ways to learn the mapping to learn the function mapping from the input size.\n",
        "To the estimated price,\n",
        "and so maybe you want to fit a quadratic function instead.\n",
        "Maybe that actually fits the data a little bit better.\n",
        "And so how do you choose among different models?\n",
        "Will be either automatically or manual intervention?\n",
        "Will be will be something we'll spend a lot of time talking about.\n",
        "Now,\n",
        "to give a little bit more to define a few more things,\n",
        "this particular example is a problem called a regression problem.\n",
        "And the term regression refers to that the value Y you're trying to predict is continuous,\n",
        "right? In contrast,\n",
        "here's a different type of problem.\n",
        "So a problem that some of my friends were working on and I'll simplify it,\n",
        "was a healthcare problem.\n",
        "Where they were looking at breast cancer,\n",
        "breast tumors and trying to decide if a tumor is benign or malignant,\n",
        "right. So a tumor, you know,\n",
        "sort of a lump in a in a woman's breast is can be maligned or cancerous or benign,\n",
        "meaning,\n",
        "you know roughly there's not that harmful.\n",
        "And so if on the horizontal axis you plot the size of a tumor.\n",
        "And on the vertical axis you plot is it malignant or not?\n",
        "So malignant means harmful, right?\n",
        "And some tumors are harmful, some are not.\n",
        "And so whether it's malignant or not,\n",
        "takes only two values, one or zero.\n",
        "And so you may have a data set like that.\n",
        "Right. And given this,\n",
        "can you learn the mapping from X to Y so that if a new patient walks into your office,\n",
        "walks into the doctor's office and the tumor size is,\n",
        "you know, say this,\n",
        "can the learning algorithm figure out from this data that you know,\n",
        "it's probably,\n",
        "well based on this data set looks like there's a high chance that that tumor is malignant,\n",
        "so.\n",
        "So this is an example of a classification problem and the term classification refers to that Y here takes on a discrete number of variables.\n",
        "So for regression problem Y is a real number.\n",
        "I guess technically prices can be rounded off to the near.\n",

        "各位同學，大家好，我是社團法人臺灣服務業發展協會李培芬什麼是提升服務品質的工具可視化的工具給大家一個提升服務品質的工具，非常好用喔這個工具就是服務藍圖，如何做服務優化落地呢？首先就是要用好這張服務藍圖欸，給大家一個專有的名詞，叫做顧客體驗旅程。什麼叫顧客體驗旅程就是顧客從進店到離店，這個過程我們稱之為顧客體驗旅程，我們要有同理心就是要能夠具體地去感受顧客從進店到離店的這個過程，你才能夠依照實際的狀況，將心比心換位思考好，掌握了顧客體驗旅程，我們就可以來繪製這個服務藍圖，它是一張圖一張現場的，把我們整體的服務現場把我們一家店收設在一張服務藍圖當中。透過這張服務藍圖，透過3點3線的詳細的繪製。我們可以掌握服務的流程，可以做缺口的檢視，也可以做重新的流程規劃，那當然畫自己的服務藍圖之外，還可以畫別人的服務藍圖，尤其你主要的競爭者，然後比較一下兩者之間的服務差異，然後持續不斷的精進，並提升我們的服務。好，我相信說道，現在大家已經迫不及待的想要學這個服務藍圖。那我們來看一看服務藍圖長得什麼樣子？嗯，各位已經看到了，好就是我運用星巴克的服務藍圖，其實這張服務藍圖我可以跟大家分享，他並不完整，他還缺少了我們剛剛講3點3線嗎？3個點都沒有，對不對，好三線還缺少一個線，就是可見線好，所以。待會，我會進一步地讓大家透過怎麼化服務藍圖，怎麼掌握3點3線好，能夠把服務藍圖把所有的現場收攝在這張藍圖之中，其實就像你去參觀工廠，可以看到工廠的流水線一關又一關流水線的工廠的配置圖一樣，其實在我們的服務現場，也可以透過這一張服務藍圖來掌握。好現場的全貌。那這張圖裡面3點1線還沒標出來，各位你還可以再看一下，支持的過程其實也不完整好，接下來我們就來看一看有哪一些舊服務藍圖怎麼來話呢？嘿，服務藍圖動手做有一張表格，各位現在已經看到這張表格了，我們的電配置在這裡，店是不變的。接觸點就是有人緣的接觸點，通常我們是在前場人員動作和後場人員的動作都可以體現，所以在最上面這個欄位的接觸點，我請大家先盤點一下這個硬體的設備好或是有什麼物品，顧客會接觸到，譬如說顧客坐下來坐在椅子上，因此他會接觸到椅子，會接觸到那個桌子。最重要的，其實所有服務的起點就是顧客進門的。這一個過程就是一個服務的起點，到顧客離開我們的店，這是一個終點，這是一個結束好，所以顧客的動作才是關鍵呢？所以顧客的動作是1號，也就是剛剛一開始跟大家介紹的顧客體驗旅程，從顧客進店開始到離店欸，它可以接觸到哪一些硬體，接觸到哪一些物品？然後他跟我們前場人員會有那個這個互動線。接下來前場人員跟後場人員也會有互動，現舉個例子，最後是可見線。舉個例子，讓大家了解這3條線在不同的那個商業服務業的業態當中，會有不同的布局，例如同樣屬於餐飲業中茶飲料業欸，他的互動線就相對簡單很多，各位我相信對於很多茶飲料店大家好，再熟悉也不過了，通常你那個這個走進結帳櫃檯，你會先看點餐板哈，那透過點餐板決定要什麼飲料，你會在。那個前臺的櫃臺那個這個點餐點完餐付完帳之後，你接下來就會在等待它出品，所以你可以看到說幅藍圖相對簡單，那個前臺人員和顧客的互動線很清楚前臺人員和後場人員的互動線也很清楚，你甚至都可以看到他們在料理臺是怎麼來出這一杯飲料的，可是走近很多的中餐館狀況就完全不同囉。好走進去，你被人員接待到一張座位上坐下來之後，其實你並看不到前場人員和後場人員的互動線，對不對？所以這個時候中菜館和茶飲料店的可見性可見是，在不同的位置上有沒有發現好有現代化的連鎖企業，我們的可見線都會盡量開放讓顧客看到，哪怕是我剛剛舉的。哪怕我是中餐館好，我都會用透明廚房的概念，讓顧客可以看到前場人員和後場人員的動作，也就是說，要不斷地降低可見線曝光在顧客面前，目的是為了讓顧客安心好，各位可以掌握這一張好服務藍圖，先把它填寫下來，可以細膩的關照顧客跟著顧客的做那個動作為中心點，然後把所有的接觸點人員的動作都一一的記錄下來。最後是大後勤，這個支持的流程就是總部和設備商支持的流程。譬如說在剛剛星巴克的服務藍圖當中，大家有看到門市會用的結帳系統，我們稱之為POS point of sales銷售時點系統，透過銷售時點系統門市可以更好的處理顧客的點單，那除了大後勤，除了POS系統之外，難道就沒有其他的支持工作嗎？其實還有對不對？我在我在舉一個例子哦，會不會有新品開發對不對？好源源不斷的有新品，那後臺需要提供新品開發的研發的支持，讓門店可以更好的營運好，掌握了這張服務藍圖填具的表格之外，接下來要怎麼用呢？關鍵的要把3點找出來，剛剛已經找到了三線，現在要把關鍵的3點找出來，哪3點呢？分別為15點等候點和決策點。我通常建議經理要帶著全體門市的店務夥伴好大家一起來進行腦力激盪，也不用一次要把3個點都畫出來，要一個一個來，然後真正地把服務藍圖真正的用起來。首先是15點，我們經常在哪裡會讓顧客感覺到不變力，會讓顧客抱怨？這是提升服務品質的要點喔，好要體察顧客的痛點，找事物點就是找顧客的痛點，譬如說我舉個例子，顧客推薦進來，覺得我們的門很重，哇，這就是一個失誤點。那過去屈臣氏也曾經有個案例，顧客在騎樓滑倒欸騎樓，這不在店裡，也是在店外。可是這依然屬於我們服務的區域顧客，因為下雨，我們的如果不重視騎樓的材質，顧客可能因為下雨就在騎樓滑倒，也有顧客在我們的店內滑倒，所以店內的地磚的使用地板的材料，這個都是非常關鍵的。我們透過失誤點是要掌握顧客的痛點，好透過幅藍圖，第一個可以優化的吼，建議剛建議大家用不同的符號，15點可以打叉叉。等候點可以用雙圓好，而那個決策點可以打星星，我們再來看等候點。各位要注重顧客的等候點，沒有人喜歡排隊，沒有人喜歡等候，各位可以觀察到麥當勞和星巴克的排隊的動線，好是完全不一樣的。麥當勞是直線型的，而星巴克是橫線型的。直線和橫線有什麼差異呢？那是因為星巴克比麥當勞更重視服務藍圖，透過服務藍圖，我們可以看見，當顧客如果是排直線的時候，顧客的視線所及只有前面的那位顧客的背影，這個時候客人什麼都看不見，只看到一個人的背影，這個時候就會覺得時間好長好長喔吼，非常的漫長很難，非常難熬。可是如果像星巴克一樣呢？當他發現顧客的空間越開闊，月能有同理心說能夠讓他分心，什麼是同理心和分心呢？當看到我們所有的吧臺人員都忙著製作飲品的時候，顧客就會有同理心，當他看到在我們的冰箱展示冰箱以及櫃臺陳列，還有很多豐富的商品，就可以分心關注商品這個分心有好處喔。還會提升我們的營業額好，所以讓顧客看到更多的商品增加點擊率增加點單率，所以這個時候也可以把劣勢轉換成優勢，找出顧客的等候點，把等候的動線更順暢的規劃，這個也是提升服務品質好，那個一個非常好的構面，沒有人喜歡等待，既然顧客付出了等待，我們就要讓他*等待的過程當中更加的覺得。舒服，更加的覺得那個這個舒適好最後一個點是決策點在決策點的時候，我就要跟大家講一條魚的故事了，這是發生在一個中餐館的一個案例號。當今天顧客點單吼他點了一條魚，用筷子夾了一口，她就招來服務人員說，欸，你們今天的魚很鹹，我不是告訴你吼，不要加太多鹽嘛哈。呃，這時我們就看到我們的夥伴好不知所措，那猶猶豫豫地一直為顧客賠小心，僅是態度良好，不斷的跟顧客抱歉吼，然後也不做任何的處理好。最後你就可以看到好客人吵吵的就結束了這一個用餐，那在餐桌上非常醒目的就是這條魚非常的完整，只夾了一口這條魚非常的完整，這位客人再也沒有上門了。這個案例將我們事後做盤點探討的時候，我們發現其實當時經理也有注意到這件事，經理也特別請廚師過來，廚師用筷子夾了一口說一點都不嫌啊。你的不鹹和顧客的不嫌吼是不其實是不一樣的吼，要有同理心，廚師也有同理心，但是前場人員應該要有同理心。好，接下來我再問那個這個，呃，經理，這條魚的那個，這個材料成本是多少錢？這條魚的成本其實那個在我們菜單上是200塊，其實成本不到80塊。我問過任何一位老闆，你願不願意為了80塊好那個這個得罪顧客，或是付出80塊留下顧客呢？100%沒有例外，所有人都願意花80塊留下顧客，但是你卻沒有授權給一線人員時的一線人員。呃，在顧客面前不知所措，無法處理。最後只能夠說啊，我會把你的抱怨好，我會把你的意見反映到公司啊，希望以後我們的廚師更能夠呃那個簡言的處理，這個都沒有用，因為我功課今天走出我們家大門大門再也不回頭了。好，這就是決策點。如何更好地授權給我們前線的服務夥伴，讓我們每一次的服務都留下完美的句點。畫好幅藍圖之後，我們再回溯一下星巴克的這張服務藍圖，我們來找一找缺少的地方，要補足拼圖的最後一個一塊拼圖，這裡面沒有可見線對不對？以星巴克為例，你看得到或是看不到後場人員。為你製作飲料為你加熱吼那個這個放上餐盤為你包裝商品呢？其實你全部看得到對不對？所以他的可見現是在兩條互動線之下，是介於後場服務人員和支持過程中最底下的一條線。當然也有一些門店夥伴會告訴我說，老師，我們的儲藏室和員工休息室顧客都看不見，是的，是的，在我們的店裡面，一定有一些空間。好顧客是看不見的，但是現代化的連鎖門市都盡量地拉低可見線，讓顧客透過透明看得見而更安心。用星巴克的案例，相信大家已經發現這件事了，好再看看支持的過程，剛剛我提了有商品研發，還有什麼呢？想想看是不是還有物流夥伴會每天源源不斷的提供給我們半成品和成品商品的配送作業呢？有沒有我們的營運督導人員會定期來到我們的店舖提供營運指導呢？還有許許多多支持的過程。大家通力合作，服務好我們的顧客，助力門市人員服務好我們的顧客。這一張符藍圖非常的重要，除了三線之外，還要找出3點本集，重點提醒大家要畫好服務藍圖，掌握3.3線。三線互動兩條互動見何可見線3點。15點等候點與決策點掌握3.3線，看到區域到總部給予門店的支持，我們是透過從總部到區域區域到店群層層向顧客支持。做好服務全體的連鎖，從總部到店群的夥伴都要動起來，才能真正創造以顧客為中心的價值。希望本集的節目大家回去要行動起來唷。一定要把我們的服務藍圖畫出來，透過帶領夥伴一起繪製服務藍圖，找出3個關鍵點，才能夠真正優化服務，做更好的服務呈現。所以本集的課後考驗就是畫一張服務藍圖，把我們的現場收設在一張服務藍圖之上。這是我們提升服務品質的一個具體的行動。本集節目到此告個段落，我們下集再見。\n",

              "\"So report this was from Sparta man 64 on the forum. Thank you for posting in the newssection says T. SMC reportedly will not make any extra capacity for Intel. It's funny theone of the first thoughts that entered my mind when I heard about Intel moving some oftheir production for future GPUs and maybe even CPU's. 2T SMC was like Oh well, that'sinteresting because that would be on probably exactly the same node that AMD would want touse for their CPUs and GPUs.And I don't know if you guys know this, but it takes not months but years to build up fabcapacity so you know you think about your the kinds of predictions that we have to do inour daily lives.Like how many times I'm not going to want to have a peanut butter and banana sandwich this week.You know how?How many?How many bananas should I get before they're all going to go bad?They are on a whole different level.They're planning, you know, five years, six years, 10 years out in advance for, you know.How much? How many chips like is the world going to need in the year 2025 and then theyare there like breaking soil on new fabs so that they will have this additional capacityand they're doing rolling upgrades of their existing fabs to meet the need for new cuttingedge manufacturing processes while also making sure that they have enough of older, lesstechnologically advanced fabrication processes that are more affordable for products thatdon't.Need the utmost in transistor density and low power consumption or whatever, so this is like this is some 40 chess going on at a company like TSMC or global foundries or Intel. Anyone who anyone who fabs anything really Samsung.Butwhat this so anyway? Yeah, so I was like oh that's hilarious because TSMC is going to havea finite amount of fab space. So if Intel is taking it up, that could limit AMD's abilityto supply enough chips to the market. I have a theory that AMD would not confirm for me.They actually outright denied it. I have a theory that threadripper Pro is OEM onlybecaus\""

              "'hello大家好，欢迎回到链接的频道，你知道吗？全球每天平均要喝掉225亿贝卡，这是什么概念？他全球一共才81个人的，也就是说，平均4个人里边就有一个人，每天要喝掉一杯咖啡，像我们平时喝的，比如说速溶咖啡罐装咖啡胶囊咖啡，你去咖啡厅喝的咖啡、咖啡粉、咖啡豆，还有那种听着很亮。厉害的什么蓝山咖啡猫屎咖啡等等。等等，你就拍这里头竟然也有这么一条鄙视链儿了，所以今天咱们就来聊一聊，到底什么样的咖啡才是好咖啡怎么样？喝咖啡就能喝出得装饰咖啡，其实他做出来，主要分三个步骤，首先你先动动第二步呢就把它烘培成，这个咖啡豆儿就咱平时那种看着黑乎。第三步呢，是把，它给研磨好了之后做成，咖啡，但是其实每一步都彰显着咖啡的歌，我们先来说说这个原材料，因为我平时看到的那些咖啡豆就黑不溜秋，我都已经烤好了，那种，我开始以为这咖啡豆他是长在地里头，我就给你一个种子一样子飞，也是咖啡的，是长在树上的，然后他从一棵树咖啡树上结出来的那种。小果子也特别漂亮红红的跟，那小樱桃似的你如果，把那个皮给扒开里边儿这两半儿，这就是我们平时看到的那个咖啡的，就相当于生的状态，有的时候我们把它叫做绿卡，也就是green coffee it，我们平时喝了咖啡，其实最常见的分两大类，一类呢，叫做arabica一类叫做如巴基斯，坦就是阿拉比卡和罗布斯塔这两种豆儿呢，我先说结论，简而言之。就是up i be up of reject讲，我们把它简称叫阿斗和罗道好了这个阿斗呢，一般来讲是比这个罗斗更优质的，这是结论大家记住了所以如果你挑想要力格高一点的洞，我们就找这种arabic百分之百的好吧，比如说你看你像这种，这不是下饭，就你可以看的很清楚，他这会且是百分之百的阿拉比卡就说明他这里边不参。萝卜丝，他就有一些他上面会写我味道，touch罗伯斯塔这种你你不知道他那个踏实踏实的多踏实，所以就尽量还是贤百分之百的，比如说下次你去男朋友家，你看他买那个咖啡豆鸭肉、巴斯，塔那你这时候就得干，你这么说，亲爱的这个是巴斯塔的咖啡因含量太高了，会让你心慌，对你身体不好，所以之后呢，我们一定要买rrap卡豆，这样就可以一扫你女汉子的形象立马，就变成一个特别清纯可爱迷人的小女生，这两种都是最主要的区别，一个是咖啡因的含量，一个是他的一些咖啡的风味的元素咖啡因呢，就是罗布斯塔豆要更高一些，因为罗布斯塔，他叫罗巴斯塔，因为就是有bug的对吧，就是感觉特别强壮，咖啡。含量高，也能让他更好的去强壮嘛，就抵抗外界的这些环境就是动词，是不怎么挑环境，像罗豆呢，就一般是东半球，比如说像越南印尼，我非洲的一些地方产的会比较多，所以我不知道大家有没有喝过那种越南咖啡机，v name is it就感觉他那里边齁甜齁甜，给你讲好多有人糖精，就是长江这些东西就因为他那铲子。那种豆都是罗道，就刺激了。刺激性很强，所以他得要特别甜的东西，然后就冲掉那些苦涩阿斗呢，你other，side d就比较娇嫩，没那么好养活，他没有那么高的咖啡因含量，所以他抵抗外界环境的能力就差一些，所以你得给他更多的呵护，就感觉像个千金大小姐一样，但是呢，大小姐大小姐的美对吧，他呢，就是更多的糖，更多的指所以还有其他的一些风味儿元素，所以整个喝起来，咖啡的那个感觉口感、味道就感觉更高级一些，所以呢，他也是在笔试上人上的，像我们平时有的时候，你听说那些产地感觉很厉害的地方，什么牙买加的蓝山咖啡有什么？曼特宁咖啡科纳咖啡，但这些地方呢主要都是产值，阿拉比卡第二个步骤就是这个烘焙。有空背上千万不要读哄配音都烘培就太掉价了，就比如说有的时候去星巴克，你要买那个主的就是不是coffee，你就看那是三个大桶，对吧一个写的blog就是感觉轻度烘培的烘焙，然后第二个是那个medium medium must就是中度，然后第三个呢是dark roast就是重度，比如说你去买咖啡的时候也是还像这个这种呢，就是它是一个lros的，就是轻度的烘焙，然后呢，比如说你看像这个我还今天特意把我们家里所有的咖啡都搬出来了，你看这个呢就写的是medium rose就是中度的这个痘，但这就是属于dark roast就是重度，这是什么意思呢其实就是相当于比，如说你要去点个牛排或者你要奸鸡蛋，你要几分熟对吧你要三份的时候5分钟还7分手，那就是轻度中度重度，如果说是轻度他就会感觉可能更更深一点，然后你会感觉到那种草本的酸涩，比如说下一次你再跟朋友出去喝咖啡，不要喝了一口，说，嗯，这咖啡怎么感觉酸酸的呢？这时候知识点就可以上来了，你说他酸可能因为他是轻度烘焙的，不如我们来一杯。做烘焙的，怎么样？然后再往后呢，他越来温度越高，温度越高之后，咖啡里头水分蒸发了，然后唐呢就慢慢的焦糖化了，然后那个油呢，也一点一点a就被轰出来了，所以你越往后，他这个逗本身颜色越深，然后再开始有点发光发亮，你喝的时候也会感'"
